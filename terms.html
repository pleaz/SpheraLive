      <p>SpheraLive is an iOS application for creating and managing YouTube Live broadcasts with real-time chat. By using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

      <h2>1. Services</h2>
      <p>The App connects to your Google/YouTube account via OAuth to create/manage live streams and display live chat. Video and audio are streamed directly from your device to YouTube's RTMP servers.</p>

      <h2>2. User Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for all content you broadcast.</li>
        <li>You must comply with YouTube’s Terms of Service and applicable laws including copyright.</li>
        <li>Do not share account credentials or use the App to stream content you are not authorized to broadcast.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>All rights to the App’s code, design, and interface belong to the developer. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to use the App in accordance with these Terms.</p>

      <h2>4. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>The App is provided “as-is” without warranties. The developer is not liable for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Third-party service outages (e.g., YouTube).</li>
        <li>Loss, corruption, or misuse of streamed content.</li>
        <li>Indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Termination</h2>
      <p>You may stop using the App at any time. The developer may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms or applicable law, without obligation or refund.</p>

      <h2>6. Changes</h2>
      <p>These Terms may be updated. If material changes occur, reasonable effort will be made to notify users. Continued use constitutes acceptance.</p>

      <h2>7. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of your country of residence. If you are in a jurisdiction with mandatory consumer protections (e.g., EU/UK), those rights apply regardless.</p>

      <h2>8. Contact</h2>
